    "# MLOps monitoring notes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flow\n",
    "    A typical continuous monitoring process consists of the following steps:\n",
    "    1. A sample of the request-response payloads is captured and stored in the serving logs store.\n",
    "    2. The monitoring engine periodically loads the latest inference logs, generates a schema, and computes statistics for the serving data.\n",
    "    3. The monitoring engine compares the generated schema to a reference schema to identify schema skews,\n",
    "    4. If the true labels (ground truth) for the serving data are available, the monitoring engine uses it to evaluate the model predictive effectiveness in hindsight on the serving data.\n",
    "    5. If anomalies are identified, or if the model’s performance is decaying, alerts can be pushed through various channels (for example, email or chat) to notify the owners to examine the model or to trigger a new retraining cycle. \n",

    "## Continuous Monitoring\n",
    "Typical assets produced in this\n",

    "• Anomalies detected in serving data\n",
